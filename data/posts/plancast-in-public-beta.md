<p>I'm happy to announce that the site I've been working on for the past half year or so - <a href="http://plancast.com/">Plancast</a> - is now available in public beta. If you haven't tried it out yet, please give it a whirl and <a href="http://plancast.com/contact">send us your thoughts</a>. I suggest you get started by posting a few plans that may be tucked away in your personal calendar. Share them on Plancast and you'll be surprised by how positively other people respond after hearing about them.</p>

<p>What does Plancast do, you ask? It helps you share your upcoming plans with friends and learn about what others will be doing in the future. Imagine how awesome it would be if we all had a better idea of what everyone was up to in the next few hours, days, weeks, or months. Thinking about grabbing drinks with friends tonight? Going to a concert tomorrow? Heading to a conference next week? Taking a trip next month? Great, it takes just seconds to share each of these plans. Your plans will reach not only your subscribers on Plancast, but your friends on Twitter and Facebook as well, if you so desire. The service a great way to spread the word about the informal social activities you do every week, whether or not you're looking for people to join you.</p>

<p>It's been an amazingly fruitful journey getting to this point, and things are especially exciting now that the site is finally live and in such good shape. I launched an "alpha" version at the beginning of September, but since it was so rudimentary, I only sent it to a handful of people for testing. With this more functional beta version (released just this past weekend), I'm encouraging everyone to check it out and invite some friends along. We're already seeing a broad range of people take a liking to it.</p>

<p>I'm also happy to announce that I've brought aboard <a href="http://marcyes.com/">Jay Marcyes</a> as a co-founder. Jay is a programming beast, not to mention a thoroughly nice guy, who was previously working full-time on another consumer internet app called <a href="http://noopsi.com/">Noopsi</a>. I'm truly lucky to have him, and I encourage you to get acquainted <a href="http://twitter.com/jaymon">on Twitter</a>. For ongoing updates about Plancast in general, you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/plancast">the official Twitter account</a> as well.</p>
